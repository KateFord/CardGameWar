# Card Game War


An object oriented solution to a 2 player card game called "War" utilizing ASP.NET MVC in Visual Studio. A large amount of my time was spent mapping out the relationships between the classes and the game logic which I feel really paid off by the time I began coding the solution.  

The object of the game is to win all of the cards. A virtual deck is divided evenly amongst the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck, creating a "battle", and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack.
