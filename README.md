# Card Game of War


An object oriented solution to a 2 player card game called "War" utilizing ASP.NET MVC in Visual Studio. The object of the game is to win all of the cards. A virtual deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack.
